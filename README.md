# 🧠 Machine Learning Journey by Anirudh

Hey! I'm Anirudh and this repo is a collection of my hands-on Machine Learning projects.  
I'm currently learning the core concepts step-by-step and applying them through real-world datasets and code.

The goal is simple: **build a solid ML foundation** and improve by actually doing, not just watching tutorials.
